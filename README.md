## Deploy your site to GitHub Pages

Deploy your site to GitHub Pages as a [User Page](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#user--organization-pages). To do so, when you are done modifying your clone, you should rename your repository to `username.github.io` where username is your username. When GitHub builds the page it will be made available at `https://username.github.io`.

If you are planning on using a custom domain to direct to your site, modify the CNAME file as described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-cname-file-to-your-repository/).
